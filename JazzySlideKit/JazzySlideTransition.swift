     Employ a damping ratio closer to zero to increase oscillation.
     
     When `dampingRatio` is 1, the animation will smoothly decelerate to its final model
     values without oscillating. Damping ratios less than 1 will oscillate more and more
     before coming to a complete stop.

     The initial spring velocity. For smooth start to the animation, match this value
     to the view’s velocity as it was prior to attachment.
     
     A value of 1 corresponds to the total animation distance traversed in one second.
     For example, if the total animation distance is 200 points and you want the start
     of the animation to match a view velocity of 100 pt/s, use a value of 0.5.
     
     You can use the initial spring velocity to specify how fast the object at the end
     of the simulated spring was moving before it was attached. It's a unit coordinate
     system, where 1 is defined as travelling the total animation distance in a second.
     So if you're changing an object's position by 200pt in this animation, and you want
     the animation to behave as if the object was moving at 100pt/s before the animation
     started, you'd pass 0.5. You'll typically want to pass 0 for the velocity.
     
     The default value is 0.

     (including those of the presenting and presented view controllers) during the animation
     sequence. UIKit sets this view for you and automatically adds the view of the presenting
     view controller to it. The animator object is responsible for adding the view of the
     presented view controller, and the animator object or presentation controller must use
     this view as the container for all other views involved in the transition.
